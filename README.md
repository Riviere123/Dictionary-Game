Dependancies: json, difflib, random
Run Dictionary.py

There are two modes. 1: give a word receive the definition. 2: you're given the definition and you must provide the word defined.
The script uses difflib to find similiarities from your input and the json data and can reccomend you close matches in case of defining and will accept your answer if its close in case of the game.
